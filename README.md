# UROP_Grp6

This is the UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme) Project done while pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.
In this we have made the Mobile-Edge-Cloud connection secure by adding a layer of AES 256 Encryption. We also have collected data for varying devices (mobile, edge and cloud) and plotted the graphs for better analysis.
